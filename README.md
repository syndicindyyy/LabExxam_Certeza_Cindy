# Simple Login Form with Navigation

## Overview
This laboratory exam is all about creating a simple login form with validation, navigation, and user redirection. It uses basic front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with Git for version control.

## Steps

1. Create `index.html`: Contains a login form with email and password fields.

2. Create `home.html`: Displays a welcome message and a logout button that redirects back to `index.html`.

3. Add `style.css`**: Basic styling for the login form and home page.

4. Add `script.js`**: JavaScript for form validation. If the fields are empty, an error is shown.
